# PROJECT 1 - VISUALIZING TIME

**Sketch and develop 3 clock faces or displays of time, through an iterative process.**

## Goals

- Introduction to coding and web design 
- Introduction to the GitHub repositories
- Introduction to iteration

## Process

- Sketch individually.
- Create twenty sketches on paper, then select 3 to pursue. 
- Add an image of your sketches to the index.html and include a brief explanation of your design.
- Create a GitHub Page site that will be the online version of your website. All your files will be accessible through the following link **yourUsername.github.io/MIT-Design-Studio-Information-and-Visualization/** . For example, the link to your project should be **yourUsername.github.io/MIT-Design-Studio-Information-and-Visualization/Project_1/index.html** 
To do so go to your repository in GitHub.com, settings, scroll to GitHub Pages and in the option source select **master branch**. Everything that you update in your master branch will be updated in the online site. If you wish to have a different branch just for your online version, create a new branch called **gh-pages**.
- Once you've finished, send us an email with a link to the online page

## Requirements

Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can choose how to draw the sketches: using canvas, d3.js, P5.js, etc.
The visualization should be optimized for viewing on a mobile device: approximately 414 x 736 pixels.
