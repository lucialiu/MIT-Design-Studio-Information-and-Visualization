        <h2 class="col-md-12">Sketch 1: Explanation</h3>
        <p>Time is represented in a literal sense with a minimalist clock face. I was playing with the idea of using circles, which reminded me of orbits in space and how the movement of time can be represented in a circular fashion. The larger hollow white circle represents the hour hand. The smaller hollow white circle represents the minute hand. The small dot represents the second hand.</p>
        <h2 class="col-md-12">Sketch 2: Explanation</h3>
        <p>Next, I wanted to experiment with viewing time in a linear fashion. The thicker line represents how much time has passed overall in a day. For example, if the line is in the middle, it represents noon. The dot on the thicker line represents how much time within the hour has passed. For example, if the dot is in the middle of the line, it represents half past the hour. The thinner line represents the seconds.</p>
        <h2 class="col-md-12">Sketch 3: Explanation</h3>
        <p>This clock uses the same concept of time linearity as the previous one. This time, the thick black strip represents how much time has passed overall in a day as it moves downward. For example, if the strip is in the middle, it represents noon. Minutes are represented by how many thin white lines are on the black strip. For example, if there are 15 white lines, it is a quarter past the hour.</p>
