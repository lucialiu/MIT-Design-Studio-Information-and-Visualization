# PROJECT 2 - Weather App

**Develop two visualizations of the current weather in Cambridge— one literal and one abstract — using three or more variables.**

## Goals

- Learn the basics of HTTP requests and JSON formats
- Design a mobile app and understand the basics of UX design
- Understand how both the literal and the abstract visualizations need to 
communicate data efficiently
- Visualize multiple, interrelated variables


## Process

- Sketch individually.
- Create sketches on paper, then select 2 to pursue. 
- Create mockups of those sketches using Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, etc.
- Add an image of your sketches and mock ups to the index.html. 
- Add a brief explanation of the final visualizations in index.html
- Once you've finished, upload it to your GitHub Repository and share in Piazza the working GitHub Pages link of the project 

## Requirements

Use data from the forecast.io API (update json file in /data/ using the url in script.js) and libraries such as Bootstrap as a starting point. The visualization should be optimized for viewing on a mobile device (approx. 1080 x 1920 pixels)
